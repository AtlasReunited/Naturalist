## Summary
Have you ever wanted a truly immersive animal mod, where animals interact with each other realistically? Naturalist adds more animals to the game that behave as they do in real life. There is a working food chain, sleep cycle, and tons of other fun behaviors, giving each animal a personality of its own. So, are you ready to venture out into the wild?
